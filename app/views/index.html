          1.5 - Revised confirmation page has been made more minimal with a link to the audit report. This proposal is to provide a more forward thinking of including history of quality review. We know down the line, there could be communication back and forth between auditors and HCP on a referral....

          1.4 - This design has reverted back to the summarylist component. It was quickly learned that the tasklist made the journey more complicated and the tags could be misinterpreted. We also learned a user need has been missed from the earlier prototype, which was to be able to see the audit report after submitting it or if they exit the journey and want to come back later. This was done as a whole page capture.

          1.3 - To try and influence user behaviour, we wanted to make it clear some area are mandatory and other sections are optional and dont have to be completed. It was agreed to use the Tasklist with tags to influence the users.
